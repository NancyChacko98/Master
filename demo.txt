Hi Jino,

This mail is regarding my asset access issue.I was previously allocated in Hitachi -Infra Mgmt-ICC account and i used TCS thinclient desktop till now.
.But now i got released from the project and got allocated to different project(SW_ORACLE 11i_MFG_NPV_OFF) where i would need to access client vdi directly 
which is not possible through thinclient right now.

Kindly approve above request for new asset(TCS Lap)

Thankyou
